# Naive-Bayes
Short Example of Naive Bayes

Libraries used: pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.model_selection -> train_test_split, sklearn.preprocessing -> StandardScaler, sklearn.naive_bayes -> GaussianNB, sklearn.metrics -> confusion_matrix,
sklearn -> metrics

Naive Bayes is good when there are multiple variables but we can assume they are indepdenent.. which is rare in a lot of real life situations / data. also doesn't really require a lot of training data and is fast
